        "The main goal of this project is to develop the best pitcher earned run average (ERA) predictive model through various forms of regression analysis, using data from various sources such as Baseball Savant, Baseball Reference, and Fangraphs. Our study will focus on building the best model through the following regression techniques, Multiple Variable Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Lagrange Interpolation, and Spline Interpolation. ERA is one of the most fundamental statistical metrics baseball front office scouts and analysts have in evaluating the effectiveness of a pitcher. Thus if a model that aids in its predictability can be constructed, then it could be a useful tool in terms of player development.\n"

        "Since 2015, baseball data and advanced metrics have become much more prevalent due to the introduction of the Statcast system. Since the introduction of the Statcast system, the amount of data teams have access to has increased steadily over the years along with more innovation being achieved due to said data. Additionally through sites such as Baseball Savant, much of this data is accessible to the public, this has led to various attempts of baseball predictive model building through regression analysis and even some machine learning techniques. When it comes to the pitching aspect of data there tends to be a lot more data available simply due to the nature of the sport as this area of the game has a lot more measure variables. Typically research is done more so on specific movement patterns of specific pitches and trying to build models that help in what is referred to as “pitch development/creation”, and this is done through measuring data on the physical pitch characteristics. Additionally many seek to creat models that improve upon the simple nature of ERA and demonstrate a more accurate form of player performance. However, the effectiveness of certain regression or other estimator models in terms of predicting ERA has not been widely explored. Thus there seems to be a gap in understanding the predictability of ERA that must be explored further.\n"
